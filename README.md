## Welcome to 42cursus-cpp-module-06!
This is the seventh project featuring C++ at the [42 school].

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to learn the different kinds of casting in C++.

In the first exercise, a small application is written, which converts the given number into some other types.  
Usage: ``./convert <a number or a character>``. It will then print something like:  
```
char:   '*'
int:    42
float:  42.0f
double: 42.0
```

The second exercise features the ``reinterpret_cast``. One has to convert an object pointer to ``uintptr_t`` and
vice versa.

In the third exercise, the type of an instance of a class with a common super class has to be found, using the reference
of the object and by using its address.
